### **Introduction to the Portable Executable (PE) Format**

The **Portable Executable (PE) format** is the file format used for executables, DLLs, drivers, and other binary files in Windows. It defines how code, data, and resources are organized within an executable file. Understanding the PE format is essential for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.

### **Why is the PE Format Important?**

1. **Executable Structure** – The PE format tells the operating system how to load and run an executable file.
2. **Malware Analysis** – Many malware samples modify or manipulate the PE structure to evade detection.
3. **Reverse Engineering** – Knowing PE structure helps in analyzing and debugging Windows binaries.

### **Common PE File Extensions:**

- **.exe** – Executable applications
- **.dll** – Dynamic Link Libraries (shared code)
- **.sys** – Windows drivers
- **.scr** – Screensaver files (can also be executable)

### **Basic PE File Structure**

A PE file is divided into several key components:

1. **DOS Header (MZ Header)** – Legacy DOS compatibility header.
2. **PE Header (NT Headers)** – Main header containing metadata about the file.
3. **Section Table** – Defines different parts of the executable (e.g., code, data, resources).
4. **Data Sections** – Contains actual executable code (.text), imports, exports, and other resources.
