### Reverse Engineering Tools

Several of the tools mentioned focus more on reverse engineering rather than development. It is essential to reverse engineer the malware built to fully understand its internal workings and have an understanding of what the malware analysts will see upon inspecting the malware.

### Tools To Install

Install the following tools:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - This is the development environment where the coding & compiling process will occur. Install the C/C++ Runtime.
    
- [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) - x64dbg is a debugger that will be used throughout the modules to get an internal understanding of the developed malware.
    
- [PE-Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear) - PE-bear is a multiplatform reversing tool for PE files. It will also be used to assess the developed malware and look for suspicious indicators.
    
- [Process Hacker 2](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php) - Process Hacker is a powerful, multi-purpose tool that helps monitor system resources, debug software and detect malware.
    
- [Msfvenom](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/) - Msfvenom is a command line interface tool that is used to create, manipulate, and output payloads.

### x64dbg

x64dbg is an open-source debugging utility for x64 and x86 Windows binaries. It is used to analyze and debug user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers. It provides a graphical user interface that allows users to inspect and analyze the state of their programs and view memory contents, assembly instructions, and register values. With x64dbg, users can set breakpoints, view stack and heap data, step through code, and read and write memory values.

### Process Hacker

Process Hacker is an open-source tool for viewing and manipulating processes and services on Windows. It is similar to Task Manager but provides more information and advanced features. It can be used to terminate processes and services, view detailed process information and statistics, set process priorities and more. Process Hacker will be useful when analyzing running processes to view items such as loaded DLLs and memory regions.

## Msfvenom

Msfvenom is a Metasploit framework standalone payload generator that allows users to generate various types of payloads. These payloads will be used by the malware created in this course.
