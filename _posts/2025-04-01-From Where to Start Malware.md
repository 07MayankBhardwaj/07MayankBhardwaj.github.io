# How to Start Malware Research: A Beginner's Guide to Becoming an Expert

*Published: April 1, 2025 | Categories: Malware, Cybersecurity | Tags: Malware, Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering, Cybersecurity*

## Introduction to Malware Research

Malware analysis is an essential cybersecurity skill for understanding threats, reverse-engineering malicious code, and building defenses against cyberattacks. Whether you're aiming to join a top-tier company like Google or simply want to explore the world of malware, this guide will help you kickstart your journey into malware research.

In this post, weâ€™ll cover what malware analysis entails, the prerequisites you need, a step-by-step learning path, and the best resources to get you from zero to hero.

## What is Malware Analysis?

Malware analysis involves dissecting malicious software to uncover its purpose, behavior, and mitigation strategies. Itâ€™s a critical process for cybersecurity professionals to detect and neutralize threats.

There are two main types of malware analysis:

1. **Static Analysis**: Examining malware without running itâ€”think code structure, strings, and binaries.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Executing malware in a safe environment to observe its real-time behavior.

Understanding both approaches is key to mastering malware research.

## Prerequisites: What You Need to Know Before Starting

Before diving into malware analysis, you should have a foundational understanding of:

1. **Operating Systems (Windows & Linux)** â€“ Malware targets both platforms, so understanding their internals is essential.
2. **Programming Languages** â€“ C, C++, Python, and Assembly are commonly used in malware development and analysis.
3. **Reverse Engineering Basics** â€“ Disassembling and analyzing binary code using tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra.
4. **Networking Concepts** â€“ Many malware variants use network connections to communicate with attackers.
5. **Virtualization & Sandboxing** â€“ Setting up a safe lab environment using VirtualBox, VMware, or a cloud-based solution.
